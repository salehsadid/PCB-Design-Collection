# PCB-Design-Collection
This repository is a collection of PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design projects, schematics, and resources. It showcases practical circuit layouts using industry-standard tools like Altium Designer and EasyEDA. Each project is documented with Schematic Diagram and PCB Layout.

As I explored PCB design with Altium Designer, I gained some valuable hands-on experience that goes far beyond just placing components on a board. Here are a few key things I learned:

ðŸ”¹ Schematic Design Workflow : 
Understanding how to organize and draw schematics clearly is crucial â€” it sets the foundation for a functional PCB.

ðŸ”¹ Component Library Management : 
Creating and managing custom footprints and symbols taught me how important accuracy is in real-world hardware design.

ðŸ”¹ Design Rule Checks (DRC) : 
I learned how Altium helps enforce electrical and manufacturing rules, ensuring the board is both functional and manufacturable.

ðŸ”¹ Layer Management & Routing Techniques : 
Routing signals while managing trace width, clearances, and via placements really improved my understanding of multilayer design principles.

ðŸ”¹ 3D Visualization : 
Being able to visualize the final board in 3D helped me grasp spacing and mechanical constraints better.

ðŸ”¹ Gerber File Generation : 
I now understand how to generate industry-standard output files to take a design from screen to fabrication.

This experience helped me connect theoretical knowledge to practical skills â€” and made me appreciate how complex and rewarding hardware design really is.
